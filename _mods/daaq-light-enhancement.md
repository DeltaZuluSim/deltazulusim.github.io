Lighting enhancement mod for [**Ain Ouessara Military Air Base (DAAQ)**](/community/algerian-military-sceneries/#daaq---ain-ouessara), built for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Strategically located in central Algeria, DAAQ serves as a major military airfield featuring dual runways and an extensive taxiway network connecting dispersal shelters and support areas.

This mod focuses on **night lighting** across all key operational zones—runways, taxiways, aprons, and shelter areas—making the base fully functional and immersive for night ops, tactical missions, and formation flying in low visibility conditions.
