This livery pack includes three meticulously detailed camouflage liveries, each representing a unique variation used by the Algerian Air Force on their fleet similar of the Transall C160 aircraft. The liveries are as follows:

**Variation 1 (Registration: 7T-WHJ):**

This version showcases a distinctive desert-camouflage pattern, reflecting the aircraft’s adaptation to Algeria's arid landscape. It features dark green, sand, and olive tones that blend seamlessly with the region’s environment. The Algerian Air Force emblem is prominently displayed on the tail, with detailed Arabic markings on the fuselage.

**Variation 2 (Registration: 7T-WHF):**

This livery combines slightly darker green and brown camouflage patterns, providing enhanced realism with weathering and shading effects that replicate operational wear. The registration and squadron insignias are accurately placed, capturing the essence of this tactical transport aircraft’s role in military operations.

**Variation 3 (Registration: 7T-WGB):**

A more modern take with subtle differences in camouflage distribution, this version includes enhanced detailing around the aircraft’s engines and propellers. The darker green and brown tones, coupled with high-resolution markings, represent the current operational colors of the Algerian Air Force’s fleet.

Each livery is crafted to offer high realism, capturing the unique characteristics of Algeria's military aviation fleet. These liveries are perfect for simmers looking to add an authentic Algerian military experience to their Azurpoly Transall C160.
