## Mission Overview

A container ship has caught fire in the Mediterranean Sea, north of Jijel, Algeria. Your role as a search and rescue (SAR) pilot is to locate the vessel, assess the situation, and report its exact coordinates and status.

## Scenario Details

- The cargo ship is drifting in the open sea with visible fire and smoke.
- The mission begins from Jijel Ferhat Abbas Airport (DAAV) or another designated airbase.
- Weather conditions may include low visibility, wind, or cloud cover, making the search challenging.
- Pilots must rely on visual spotting, onboard avionics, and SAR techniques to pinpoint the ship's location.
- Report fire intensity, structural damage, and potential hazards for ground-based rescue teams.

## Mission Objectives
- Locate the burning vessel.
- Provide accurate coordinates for rescue operations.
- Assess and describe the fire, damage, and crew status (if visible).
- Return to base after completing the reconnaissance.

This scenario is designed to test your observational skills, navigation, and SAR reporting capabilities in a realistic environment.
