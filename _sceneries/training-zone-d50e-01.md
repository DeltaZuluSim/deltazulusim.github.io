Custom SO Scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 & 2024
{:.notice}

This scenery has been developed for SO Simmers to enhance their training exercises and enjoy realistic military operations. It is located within Military Area D50E, south of Oran and north of Mécheria, making it an ideal training ground for military and tactical flight operations.

Pilots can reach the area by:

- Departing Bousfer Air base (DAOE) or Tafraoui Air base (DAOL) and flying southbound.
- Taking off from Mécheria Airport (DAAY) and flying northbound.
- Navigating via Oran VOR (ORA 114.0) using radial 360° or 180°, depending on the departure point.

Designed with realism and immersion in mind, this scenery provides a challenging and strategic training environment for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 & 2024.
