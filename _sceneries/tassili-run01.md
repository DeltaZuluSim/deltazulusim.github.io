Custom SO Scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 & 2024  
{:.notice}

## Scenario Overview

**Tassili Run 01** is a high-speed desert canyon challenge located in the massive **Tassili n’Ajjer plateau**, south of Illizi, Algeria.  
This scenery adds **smoke markers only** — no airport, no runway, no objects — designed for multi player flights and fast terrain-following navigation.

Two smoke pairs define the route:

- **Start Gate:** Red smoke on the right and left  
- **End Gate:** Red smoke on the right and left  

The run follows natural dry riverbeds and steep canyon walls in one of the most dramatic landscapes of the Sahara.

{% include map-single.html coordinates=page.coordinates %}

## Mission Objectives

- Enter the Tassili canyon system south of Illizi.
- Identify the **first smoke pair** marking the start of the run.
- Follow the canyon at low altitude and high speed.
- Maintain terrain masking and avoid ridge crossings.
- Pass through the **final smoke pair** marking the end.
- Optionally reverse the run or regroup for formation.
