Scenery for **Laghouat Air Base (DAUL)**, designed for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Located in central Algeria, this strategic military installation sits on the semi-arid high plains of Laghouat, offering an expansive and tactical environment for military aviation operations.

This scenery captures the full complexity of DAUL, featuring its **parallel runways**, **dispersed hardened shelters**, and **dedicated helicopter aprons**. The airbase layout supports various mission profiles, from fast jet ops to rotary-wing deployments. Whether you’re planning formation flights, training sorties, or immersive combat scenarios, DAUL brings you a rich, high-performance platform with day and night usability.
